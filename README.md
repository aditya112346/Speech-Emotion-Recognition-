# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-
The project focuses on developing a machine learning model to identify emotions in speech using the Toronto Speech Emotion Recognition dataset from Kaggle. The project involved preprocessing audio data by extracting features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), followed by training and evaluating models such as (SVM) and (CNN).
